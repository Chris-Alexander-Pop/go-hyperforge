/*
Package algorithms provides implementations of common algorithms for distributed systems, graph processing, and sorting.

Highlights:
  - Consistency: Paxos, Raft, Consistent Hashing
  - Graph: A*, Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, Louvain
  - Rate Limiting: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Sliding Window
  - Load Balancing: Round Robin, Least Connections, Consistent Hash
